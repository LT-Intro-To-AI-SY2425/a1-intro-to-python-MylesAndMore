# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

These aren't exactly my initial thoughts as I've used Python before, but it's pretty cool. I always enjoy its simplicity.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Python is object-oriented and procedural like many programming languages I've used, and the biggest difference is just that it's much simpler in areas such as boilerplate and syntax.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I mostly used this assignment as an opportunity to relearn some of my Python skills from many years ago, so I didn't learn a ton. I haven't used asserts before (at least in Python), so that was something new for me.
